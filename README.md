My First Lab
Define on paper, all the use cases (functionalities) you will need 
for this page.
• Make a simple storyboard of the user using the system.
• Create a git repository for the project
• Clone the project locally
• Work on the project creating 2 branches, one for the UI, and one 
for rolling the dice, committing and merging when completed.
• Create the roll functionality by passing an argument, in order to 
reutilise the same function multiple times
• Write a test for the roll dice functionality.
• When complete, push the content to your git repository
